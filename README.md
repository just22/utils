# Command-line utilities for Unix-like systems

This is a collection of small utilities I use on a daily basis.
Most of them are shell or TCL scripts, but there could be some
Perl/whatever code I copied who-knows-from-where.

My main intent here is _portability_; I use different Unix-like OSs: RedHat
Enterprise Linux at work, MacOS, OpenBSD and some Linux flavors at home;
of course, I like my apps behaving coherently wherever I run them.
