# just22's utils

This is my utils repository, a collection of small utilities I use on a daily
basis. Most of them are shell or TCL scripts, but there could be some
Perl/whatever code I copied who-knows-from-where.

My main concern here is portability; I use different Unix-like OSs: RedHat
Enterprise Linux at work, mostly OpenBSD and some Linux flavors at home;
of course, I like my apps behaving coherently wherever I run them.


## Installation

git clone https://github.com/just22/utils.git

then, add your local repository to PATH variable (or just link some files in
a directory in your executable path).
