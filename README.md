# just22's utils

This is my utils repository, a collection of small utilities I use on a daily
basis. Most of them are shell or TCL scripts, but there could be some
Perl/whatever code I copied who-knows-from-where.

Main concern here is portability; I use different Unix-like OSs: RedHat
Enterprise Linux at work, some Linux flavours and mostly OpenBSD at home and,
of course, I like my apps behaving coherently wherever I run them.
